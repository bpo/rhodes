# RhoStudio Test Plan

## On Testing In General

Any deviation from the described behaviour is a possible bug and should be reported to the developers.

## On Virtual Machines

It is recommended to run all tests on virtual machines (e.g. using freeware [Oracle VirtualBox](http://www.virtualbox.org/)) on Windows XP, Windows 7, Mac OS 10.6 Snow Leopard, Mac OS 10.7 Lion.

1. Create virtual (guest) machine for selected operating system. Use the default settings for each virtual machine except:
   1. For Windows XP:
      - General > Basic > Version = Windows XP
      - Virtual HDD: 100 GB (dynamically allocated)
      - System > Motherboard > Base Memory = 1024 MB
      - Display > Video > Enable 3D Acceleration = check
      - Display > Video > Enable 2D Video Acceleration = check
      - Display > Video > Video Memory = 128 MB
   2. For Windows 7:
      - General > Basic > Version = Windows 7
      - Virtual HDD: 100 GB (dynamically allocated)
      - System > Motherboard > Base Memory = 2048 MB
      - Display > Video > Enable 3D Acceleration = check
      - Display > Video > Enable 2D Video Acceleration = check
      - Display > Video > Video Memory = 256 MB
   3. For Mac OS X:
      - General > Basic > Version = Mac OS X Server (64 bit)
      - Virtual HDD: 100 GB (dynamically allocated)
      - System > Motherboard > Base Memory = 2048 MB
      - Display > Video > Enable 3D Acceleration = check
      - Display > Video > Enable 2D Video Acceleration = uncheck
      - Display > Video > Video Memory = 128 MB

      Note that only Mac OS X Server license allows an installation on virtual machines, and that virtual machine must run on Apple hardware.
      This means that it's illegal to install regular Mac OS X to virtual machine even on Apple hardware.
      And of course it's completely illegal to install Mac OS X or Mac OS X Server to any non-Apple hardware
      (to virtual machine or as a primary operating system).

   Pay attention to `System > Processor > Processors` property -- if you plan to connect USB devices directly to virtual machine, set the number of processors strictly to 1
   (this is a workaround for the bug in VirtualBox). Also for USB pass-thru you need to install VirtualBox Extension Pack and, if VirtualBox is installed on Linux host, then you need
   to add all users runnung virtual machines to `vboxusers` group.
2. Install desired operating system to virtual machine using original installation media (CD or DVD) and product license key
   (see VirtualBox help and documentation for details on guest operating systems installation).
3. Install all updates, service packs and official patches for installed OS.
4. Install all latest avaiable SDKs for supported mobile platforms:
   1. Install latest Android SDK and NDK. Run Android SDK Manager to download and install all latest tools, platforms and APIs.
      Don't use path with spaces, install SDK and NDK to something like `C:\Anrdoid\android-sdk` and `C:\Anrdoid\android-ndk` on Windows
      and to something like `/Developer/SDKs/android-sdk` and `/Developer/SDKs/android-ndk` on Mac.
   2. On Windows: install Visual Studio 2008 and Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK Refresh
      (don't forget to run Microsoft Update after Visual Studio installation to apply all latest updates, service packs and fixes).
5. Shutdown virtual machine and create a snapshot.
6. Before testing of each new version of RhoStudio restore the virtual machine state from this snapshot.
7. After release of the update, service pack or official patch for the operating system and/or mobile platforms SDKs:
   - restore the virtual machine state from latest snapshot;
   - install the updates, service packs and/or patches;
   - shutdown virtual machine and create new snapshot;
   - delete old (previous) snapshot.

Thus you will always have an up-to-date clean fresh installation of each operating system with all required SDKs for testing purposes.

Never create a snapshot of crashed or abnormally exited virtual machine! Always restore previous good state
from latest snapshot, install neccesary updates/service-packs/patches, create new snapshot, and delete previous snapshot.

Deletion of previous snapshots lets you save a lot of free disk space on a physical (host) machine especially for Windows virtual machines (guests).

## Testing Windows installation

Take just installed Windows XP or Windows 7 with all latest Microsoft Service Packs and hotfixes applied, Android SDK, Android NDK, Visual Studio 2008, and Windows Mobile 6 Professional SDK Refresh installed.

### Installation failure test on Windows without JRE

1. Download and run RhoStudioInstallerX.Y.Z.exe
2. Go through the installation wizard until message appears: "Java Runtime Environment could not be found on your computer.
   Please install Java Runtime Environment before RhoStudio" (if this message does not appear and install starts,
   then it's a bug).

### Installation success test on Windows with JRE

1. Install latest JRE.
2. Run RhoStudioInstallerX.Y.Z.exe again.
3. Go through the installation wizard, leave all settings at their defaults.
4. Installation must start then. It takes some time.
5. On the last installation step the Git installer should appear. Install Git leaving all default settings.
   When it's done, click `Finish` button. If you didn't unselect 'View ReleaseNotes.rtf', then the Release Notes window will appear -- just close it.
6. On the last screen of RhoStudio installation wizard click `Finish`. If you didn't unselect 'View Readme', then README.html will be opened in the separate default browser window.
7. Check that RhoStudio group appears on Start Menu and contains `RhoStudio` and `Uninstall RhoStudio` shortcuts.

## Testing Mac OS X installation

Take a fresh clean installation of Mac OS X with all available Software Updates (excluding Java), latest Android SDK and Android NDK installed.

### RhoStudioInstaller appearance test

1. Download and open RhoStudioInstallerX.Y.Z.dmg
2. You will see `RhoStudio -> Applications` in the first row (top part of the window), and `README.html`, `Install gems`, `Install gems on rvm`, `samples` on the next rows (below).

### Installation failure test on Mac OS X without Xcode

1. Open `Install gems` shorcut. The Terminal window will appear.
2. If asked for password, enter your password.
3. The message will appear: "Please install building tools"

### Installation failure test on Mac OS X without Java

1. Install latest available Xcode with iOS SDK.
2. Open `Install gems` shorcut again.
3. If asked for password, enter your password.
4. The message will appear: "Please install java development kit"

### Installation success test on Mac OS X with Xcode

1. Open Terminal application and type `java` command. The window will appear asking you about installation of Java -- agree and proceed JDK installation.
2. Open `Install gems` shorcut again.
3. If asked for password, enter your password.
4. When `[Process completed]` appears, close this window and open new Terminal window.
5. Type `gem list` and make sure the following gems are on the list:
