#Rhodes Application Generator

Rhodes utility is a generator which the user uses to create Rhodes applications, models, and tests (specs). 

## Generating an Application

You pass your application name to the rhodes app command as a parameter. The Rhodes utility will generate a default directory structure for your application, with default code for the generated files.

	Usage: rhodes app name [options] [args]

	Generate a new rhodes application.

	Required:
	  name        - application name

	args (optional):
	  syncserver  - url to the source adapter (i.e. "" or "http://myacct.rhohub.com/apps/myapp/sources/")
	  zip_url     - optional url to zipfile download of bundle (this can be your RhoHub Bundle URL)

	options:
	    -p, --pretend                    Run, but do not make any changes.
	    -f, --force                      Overwrite files that already exist.
	    -s, --skip                       Skip files that already exist.
	    -d, --delete                     Delete files that have previously been generated with this generator.
	        --no-color                   Don't colorize the output
	    -h, --help                       Show this message
	        --debug                      Do not catch errors

For example, the following command generates an application named myspace.

	:::term
	$ rhodes app myspace

The generated application has the following directory structure and files.

	myspace/
		Rakefile
		build.yml
		rhoconfig.txt
	./app:
		application.rb
		index.bb.erb
		index.erb
		layout.erb
		loading.html
		loading.png
	./app/Settings:
		controller.rb	
		home.bb.erb	
		home.erb	
		index.bb.erb	
		index.erb	
		login.bb.erb	
		login.erb	
		reset.bb.erb	
		reset.erb	
		wait.bb.erb	wait.erb
	./app/helpers:
		application_helper.rb
		browser_helper.rb
	./icon:
		<default application icons; modify these to have your own app icon>
	./public:
	./public/css:
	   	<default set of css for different platforms>
	./public/images:
		<default images used by js libraries>
	./public/jquery:
		<jQuery js script with some rhomobile fixes>
	./public/jqmobile:
		<jQuery Mobile js script with some rhomobile fixes>
	./public/js:
	   	<default js libraries>

## Adding a Model to Your Application

Once you have generated your application, you can add a model to it, and the model can have attributes. For example, if you have a store application, you can add a model named product, and attributes like brand, name, price, and quantity.

	Usage: rhodes model [options] [args]

	Generate a new model for a rhodes application.

	args:
	  name        - model name
	  attributes  - list of one or more attributes (i.e. name,industry,progress), NO spaces between attributes
  
	options:
	    -p, --pretend                    Run, but do not make any changes.
	    -f, --force                      Overwrite files that already exist.
	    -s, --skip                       Skip files that already exist.
	    -d, --delete                     Delete files that have previously been generated with this generator.
	        --no-color                   Don't colorize the output
	    -h, --help                       Show this message
	        --debug                      Do not catch errors

For example, here is the command to generate a model named account, with the attributes name and industry.

	:::term
	$ cd myspace
	$ rhodes model account name,industry

This will generate the following files in the folder app/Account:

* app/Account/index.erb - the template to display the list of objects
* app/Account/edit.erb - the template to edit an object
* app/Account/new.erb - the template to supply values to create a new object
* app/Account/show.erb - the template to displays the selected object
* app/Account/index.bb.erb - the template to display the list of objects on Blackberry
* app/Account/edit.bb.erb - the template to edit an object on Blackberry
* app/Account/new.bb.erb - the template to supply values to create a new object on Blackberry
* app/Account/show.bb.erb - the template to displays the selected object on Blackberry
* app/Account/account_controller.rb - contains the basic CRUD actions: index, new, create, edit, update and delete.
* app/Account/account.rb - contains Account model definition

A placeholder for Account test specs will be generated in the app/test folder:

* app/test/account_spec.rb - placeholder for Account test specs

## Add test framework

To add a test framework to the application:

	Usage: rhodes spec

	Add test framework to a rhodes application.


For example:

	:::term
	$ cd myspace
	$ rhodes spec

This will generate the following files in the app folder:

* SpecRunner/controller.rb - contains index action, which start all tests
* SpecRunner/index.erb - the template to display tests results
* mspec.rb - contain all mspec required files
* spec_runner.rb - contain spec framework initialization and generate list of spec files

If you are going to use mspec, then add mspec and fileutils extensions to your application's build.yml file:

	extensions: ["mspec", "fileutils"]

To run the tests you need to add a link to the SpecRunner controller in your index.erb:
	:::html
	<li><a href="SpecRunner">Run tests</a></li>

Once you click the link a summary of the results with number of passing/failing tests will be displayed on the screen.
